--> Youth (Students & young adults)

## Problems
What problems are people facing? 
How are these already being solved? 
--> people have trouble finding activities to do, especially for group outings 
--> recommendations from friends and blogs

## Solution
Whatâ€™s your solution, in one sentence?  
Can you find an analogy to describe it?  
--> recommendations by providing details of activities done by others together with their ratings
--> like Amazon for activities

## Assumptions
What assumptions are we making that the project depends on?
--> people face this problem
--> people would be bothered to use a website for this
--> the website would actually suggest things that people want

## Unique Selling Point
Our version will succeed because it will be somewhat similar to social media. You can follow suggestors whom you trust/have preferences similar to yours. (we hope)

## Competitors
What competitors are there? List 5. Surely you can google 5.
Why are we better or different?
--> TripAdvisor (more for tourists)
--> Families for life (MSF) (more for families)
--> blogs (they show limited activities: top 10, etc)
